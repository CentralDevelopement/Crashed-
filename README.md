This is Central developements first resource 
All that this resource does is spawns the player on a bmx with the command /crashed if the player crashed and lost his car
The script checks if the player has used the command already and if used already in that session it will not spawn the bmx
so it only works ones if the players game crashed or if the player hasn't used the command in that session
